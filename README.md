# TaskPaper2Themes

It's a clone from <http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/wiki/TaskPaperThemes>. Many of the themes over there are shared as plain text in HTML. So I copied it here.

i.e. they are not created by me unless otherwise indicated. Individual authorship are indicated in the each individual theme.

It also includes the default themes from the TaskPaper2 app. Basically I use a symbolic link to point this folder to `~/Library/Application Support/TaskPaper/Themes`. This has a potential issue about copyright. But since the themes are pretty gneric XML codes, I hope there's no such problem.

But in case it does, please let me know and I will seperate them.
